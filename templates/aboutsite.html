    <h1>What is this site for?</h1>
    <h2>Aims</h2>
    <p>This site is a signpost for the activities and I'm involved with and a place to share a few of my interests. You can read about my musical activities, my research or my music engraving projects. I've taken a recent interest in dev, so have also got my own git server, open for perusal (though there's not that much of interest, to be fair).<br><br>I'm thinking about blogging in some form from time to time, mainly airing my inconsistent philosophies regarding technology, privacy and similar issues.<br><br>Feel free to <a href="{{ url_for('contact_page') }}">contact me</a> directly if you want to know more about something and/or discuss anything you read here.</p>
    <p>The web is becoming increasingly flawed. It is dominated by the self-centred aims of tech giants whose services we all use because of their alleged convenience. I am not on mainstream social mediia (though I am on Mastodon; I'm still making my mind up about whether or not I like it - though I support the concept). Thus, I'm using this site to revert to the late 90s / early 00s notion where one's website was one's primary outlet for sharing views, content and other information. Why should F*k, G*e and T*r profit from something I can just do myself?!
    <h2>A little about this website build</h2>
    <p>This site is a simple bunch of static html pages (wonderful static html!), with a basic stylesheet.<br>That's about it..!<br>No CMS. No cookies. No analytics. No Javascript.</p>
<p>The original plan was to just write each page out, old school. Then I thought about going down the Hugo route. In the end, I decided to take the opportunity to learn a few new skills: This site has been created completely from the ground up using Python with the Flask interface. My local files make use of some json databases, but I then use Frozen-Flask to 'freeze' the site into static html pages, which I just upload to my server.<br>So simple! No need to even deploy Flask on my server!<br> It is just a bog standard minimal site, as that's all that is needed!</p>{% endblock %}
