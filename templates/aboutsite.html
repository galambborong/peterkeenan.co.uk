    <h1>What is this site for?</h1>
    <h2>Aims</h2>
    <p>The web is becoming increasingly flawed. It is dominated by the self-centred aims of tech giants whose services we all use because of their alleged convenience. I am not on mainstream social media (though I am on Mastodon; I'm still making my mind up about whether or not I like it - though I support the concept). Thus, I'm using this site to revert to the late 90s / early 00s notion where one's website was one's primary outlet for sharing views, content and other information. Why should F*k, G*e and T*r profit from something I can just do myself?!</p><p>This site is a signpost for the activities I'm involved with and a place to share a few of my interests. You can read about my musical activities, my research or my music engraving projects. I've also taken a recent interest in dev.</p><p>I'm thinking about blogging in some form from time to time, mainly airing my inconsistent philosophies regarding technology, privacy and similar issues.</p><p>Feel free to <a href="{{ url_for('contact_page') }}">contact me</a> directly if you want to know more about something and/or discuss anything you read here.</p>
    <h3>Linode</h3>
<p>My VPS provider is <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linode.com/">Linode</a>. I think they are an excellent outfit with a great service. If you are thinking about using their services, use this <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://www.linode.com/?r=b4c31773e6e37a58d58b7531aa1d76ed8d6a052b">referral link</a> and we both get a bit of credit on our accounts.</p>
    <h2>A little about this website build</h2>
    <p>This site is a simple series of static html pages (wonderful static html!), with a basic stylesheet.</p><p>That's about it... !</p><p>No CMS. No cookies. No analytics. No Javascript.</p>
<p>The original plan was to just write each page out, old school. Then I thought about going down the <a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://gohugo.io/">Hugo</a> route. In the end, I decided to take the opportunity to learn a few new skills: This site has been created completely from the ground up using Python with the Flask framework. My local files make use of some json databases, but I then use Frozen-Flask to 'freeze' the site into static html pages, which I just upload to my server.</p><p>So simple! No need to even deploy Flask on my server.</p><p>It is just a bog standard minimal site, as that's all that is needed</p>{% endblock %}
